[Hugo Blox Builder](https://hugoblox.com) is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.

**Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.

## Video

Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:

{{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

**Youtube**:

    {{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}

**Bilibili**:

    {{</* bilibili id="BV1WV4y1r7DF" */>}}

**Video file**

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

    {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}

## Podcast

You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page's folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the _audio_ shortcode:

    {{</* audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" */>}}

Try it out:

{{< audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" >}}

## Test students

Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the `spoiler` shortcode:

```markdown
{{</* spoiler text="👉 Click to view the solution" */>}}
You found me!
{{</* /spoiler */>}}
```

renders as

{{< spoiler text="👉 Click to view the solution" >}} You found me 🎉 {{< /spoiler >}}
